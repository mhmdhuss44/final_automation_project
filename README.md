# Final Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in implementing automation infrastructure and developing tests using Selenium. The project emphasizes adherence to test automation best practices, including test isolation, parallelism, and stability..

## Scope
- Write a test plan covering all aspects of testing.
- Develop automation infrastructure using the Page Object Model (POM).
- Implement UI tests with actions, validations, and assertions.
- Ensure test isolation, parallelism, and stability.
- Structure code in layers: infra, logic, tests.
- Utilize Git for version control with pull requests and code reviews.


## Test Environment
The testing environment will be centered on the GeeksforGeeks website, renowned for its plethora of features and functionalities, rendering it an optimal candidate for comprehensive testing. Various test types, including functionality, usability, and compatibility, will be executed. Furthermore, tests will be conducted across diverse browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to validate compatibility across different platforms, encompassing both Windows and macOS environments.
